npm run dev

To create a React app using Vite with a clean, blank state and avoid the prefilled background and Vite logo, you can follow these steps:

1. Create the React App Using Vite
Start by creating the React app as you normally would:

bash
Copy code
npm create vite@latest my-first-react-app -- --template react
2. Navigate to the Project Directory and Install Dependencies
Move into the project directory and install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd my-first-react-app
npm install
3. Remove Unnecessary Prefilled Content
Now, clean up the prefilled content:

Remove the Vite Logo and Unnecessary Files:

Delete the src/assets folder which contains the Vite logo.
In src/App.jsx, remove the import of the Vite logo and any other unnecessary code.
Update the App.jsx File:

Replace the existing code in src/App.jsx with a simple clean component:

javascript
Copy code
import React from 'react';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, React!</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
Clean the index.css:

If you want a completely clean start, you can also clear the src/index.css file or remove it entirely if you prefer to handle styles differently.

Update the index.html File:

In public/index.html, you can remove any unnecessary metadata or comments that Vite adds by default.

4. Start the Development Server
Now that the app is clean and blank, you can start the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
Your React app will now start with a blank state, without any unnecessary prefilled content or logos.
