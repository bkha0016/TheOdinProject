# TheOdinProject
Doing my web developer course using the odin project. Why the odin project? its because its way easier than full stack open by
UHelnksi and it might become a prereq before I enrolled in full stack open. Most of the material here are pretty straight foward if 
you have extensive coding experience. In other words, this course is perfect for beginners in the web development world!
